        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Buche de Noel is the French name for a Christmas cake shaped like a log.</p>
        <p>This one is a heavenly flourless chocolate cake rolled with chocolate whipped cream. Traditionally, Buche de Noel is decorated with confectioners' sugar to resemble snow on a Yule log.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar </li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>6 egg yolks </li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 and a half teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 egg whites </li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar </li>
            <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.</li>
            <li>Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
